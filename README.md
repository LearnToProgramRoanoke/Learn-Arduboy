# Learn-Arduboy
Introduction to programming using the Arduboy to create simple games

Designed to be a series of lessons that provides a fun and entertaining introduction to programming using the awesome Arduboy game system. Examples of lessons to be developed include:

* **Hello World** - an introduction to the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and connecting the computer to the Arduboy with an USB cable. To begin the journey, this lesson will include the ever-popular “Hello World” as the very first program and then advance to other variations of displaying text on the screen.

* **Eight Ball Magic** - as the next step, this lesson will include a text game based on the classic Magic Eight Ball. This simple program demonstrates using an array to store the text to display, capture button presses, code different functions and incorporate bitmaps that are displayed on the screen.
